I chose to install Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit  Having very little available space on my PC i downloaded Windows 7 to an SSD hard drive to install it from there. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit to my computers. Failure in event log is : Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070002: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3093266).

I've been online with MS tech support most of the afternoon and they can't figure it out. A bit of googling leads me to believe that the upgrade is failing because I've added an m.2 SSD as my boot device / C: drive, and now use the stock, original C: drive HDD as secondary storage, now labelled.
